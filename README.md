My Merge Sort
=============

I'm taking a MOOC on algorithm design, and aiming to construct my own Ruby version of all the example algorithms it covers.

I needed a bit of prompting for this one, but it's at least partly my own code. To run it, require './lib/merge_sort' in irb, and use it as an array method.
